## Agenda

- What is image?
  - 8 bit image - each pixel can be any value from 0 to 255
  - Image as a matrix
  - Grayscale vs RGB image

- Create color swatches using matrices

  - Color

- Read and write image -- grayscale ([bit.ly/graylamp](http://bit.ly/graylamp))
- Show image
- See image dimensions
- Save an image
- Increase the brightness of an image
- Increase the contrast of the image
- Mirror an image - horizontal, vertical
- Transpose an image

- Read a color image -- ([bit.ly/naturejpg](http://bit.ly/naturejpg))
- Convert to grayscale


- Reduce the image size
  - Save the reduced size image
- Convert image to grayscale
